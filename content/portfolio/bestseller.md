## Design Process

As the guidance tool for UX design, the team used the elements of user experience model (Garret, 2011) where we firstly concentrated on deciding on the main **objectives** for the project. Concretely, we wanted to improve the customer experience in the Bestseller showrooms, as a means of adding traffic to the DIRECT platform. To achieve this, we started out with identifying the **customer needs**, when they are visiting a showroom. Our research shows that B2B retail salespeople are constantly under pressure in order to maximize sales time. In a pool of ten or more accounts and a dozen products, there are hundreds of options on what to sell to whom. This means that visiting showrooms is just a routine where buyers have to quickly make decisions. If through our concept solution, during the showroom visit we could show the purchasers that they could save time – their most valuable commodity – by using DIRECT, then we would already have come a long way.  The concept we have come up with needed to have a set of **functional specifications** of the technology used on one hand, and content to

The **visual UI elements** will enhance the virtual reality experience, and thus bring the audience closer to the web system itself, i.e. making them feel they are inside the website. This also helps to divide the system into smaller parts to simplify the usage instructions. It has to be stressed, that we used the elements of the user experience model as an inspiration to define the considerations we made when creating a conceptual solution that includes a digital {{< image src = "/images/visual-ui-elements.png" align = "right" width = "80%" >}}

installation. Therefore, the model was not used as a development model, rather it was a guideline to keep track of what we could include in our creative process.

The research showed that Vero Moda B2B customers are neglecting to use DIRECT, however, the exact reasons for that have not been discovered due to no access to interviewing the customers. Ideally, one would prefer to separate each customer segment, since their needs are different, based on if they are retail or wholesale purchasers.

## Concept
The chosen concept is a short educational video, that will promote to the purchasers why and how to use the features of DIRECT. The twist is in using the right technology: Virtual Reality – to fully captivate their attention, isolating the noise and environmental disturbance, thus causing them to entirely focus on the experience. The **content** will be presented in an interactively designed 360 degrees video that gives the customer the feeling of being inside a virtual room and sensing the movements through his eyes. 

The concept solution is not a final product. It is a mere suggestion of a digitally immersive experience that serves the purpose of educating people and promoting the service.

DIRECT now stands for **Digitally Immersive Recreated Experience for Customer Training**. Because at the end of the day no matter how user-friendly, intuitive and simple DIRECT is, it can not serve the purpose, if none of the customers and sales representatives are using it. Therefore having a clear vision on how to introduce the concept and teach the users is essential. The claim isn’t that the proposed concept is the solution to the problem, but it is most definitely a good start.
