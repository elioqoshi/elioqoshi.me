> To be inline with the new Firefox Photon Design system, we worked on a fork specifically tailored for Thunderbird, including a revamped logo and word mark. We also set the stage for an upcoming UI redesign in the future by conducting a small Usability Study specifically tailored on security features out-of-the-box within Thunderbird.

## Design challenge
The Thunderbird project has been welcoming to suggestions and help, allowing us to enjoy the process thoroughly beyond simply handing off the deliverables.

> **How can we improve the citizen service way-finding experience, without the customers having to approach the main info desk?**


## New Logo

After the Firefox logo was revamped in 2017, a Thunderbird contributor filed a ticket on Bugzilla suggesting to follow Firefox’ lead and redesign the Thunderbird logo according to the new Photon Design guidelines. This coincided with our own experiments on how Thunderbird’s logo could be like so we joined the conversation on Bugzilla. The new logo appeared in Thunderbird 60.

## Users
The target group for this challenge is the typical citizen service customer. Essentially anyone from a person who needs to get a driver’s license or residence to someone who needs to get clarification about pension issues. The users span in both Danes and foreigners (non-danish speaking) of all ages, genders or ethnic groups.

## User research
First, we had to get the knowledge from the customers (users) of citizen service. Several sessions of on-site ethnographic observations and personal interviews provided us with insights on the target group’s pains and behavioral patterns. The real way-finding problem was within citizen service. The customers were going straight to the main desk to ask for information, and 80% of the questions were related to citizen service.

Way-finding at the citizen service area was not as easy for the customers as one would think.  Starting by finding the check-in tablets, clicking on the right department, knowing how far in the queue you are and staring at a screen with numbers while you wait. These were the customer-inspired problems we addressed, to create conceptual and digital improvements.

## Design process
Several cues accumulated by the insights created the framework of the design solution. In this case, we followed a direct solution approach – where we identified the most repeated pain points of the customers and went on to solve just them.

## Design solution
The concept created to solve the challenge is Citixperience: the series of improvement to the citizen service experience. What is improved: -Finding citizen service and information about it in DOKK1 The digital screens already hanging on DOKK1 entrance pillars, were used in what we believe it is a more efficient way by giving guidance to the customers from the first moment where they enter. Furthermore, a big visible sign above the citizen service information desk is designed in the current colors and font, to match the theme of DOKK1.
