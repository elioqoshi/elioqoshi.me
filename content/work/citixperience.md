## Design challenge
DOKK1 is Aarhus’ public library and is considered as one of the icons of the city in 2017. Despite its astonishing architecture and public popularity, the library is facing customer experience challenges of the digitalization age.

> **How can we improve the citizen service way-finding experience, without the customers having to approach the main info desk?**

## Users
The target group for this challenge is the typical citizen service customer. Essentially anyone from a person who needs to get a driver’s license or residence to someone who needs to get clarification about pension issues. The users span in both Danes and foreigners (non-danish speaking) of all ages, genders or ethnic groups.

## User research
First, we had to get the knowledge from the customers (users) of citizen service. Several sessions of on-site ethnographic observations and personal interviews provided us with insights on the target group’s pains and behavioral patterns. The real way-finding problem was within citizen service. The customers were going straight to the main desk to ask for information, and 80% of the questions were related to citizen service.

Way-finding at the citizen service area was not as easy for the customers as one would think.  Starting by finding the check-in tablets, clicking on the right department, knowing how far in the queue you are and staring at a screen with numbers while you wait. These were the customer-inspired problems we addressed, to create conceptual and digital improvements.

## Design process
Several cues accumulated by the insights created the framework of the design solution. In this case, we followed a direct solution approach – where we identified the most repeated pain points of the customers and went on to solve just them.

## Design solution
The concept created to solve the challenge is Citixperience: the series of improvement to the citizen service experience. What is improved: -Finding citizen service and information about it in DOKK1 The digital screens already hanging on DOKK1 entrance pillars, were used in what we believe it is a more efficient way by giving guidance to the customers from the first moment where they enter. Furthermore, a big visible sign above the citizen service information desk is designed in the current colors and font, to match the theme of DOKK1.
