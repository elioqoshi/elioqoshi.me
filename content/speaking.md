As you might have found out, I like to speak at conferences, meetups and other events from time to time. Although being no developer myself, I like to think that I get along pretty well with technical content, so I’m quite happy to mingle in technical conferences like FOSDEM as well.

Since 2013, I have done public speaking in various local and regional events and I am currently a Mozilla Tech Speaker, part of a dedicated group of speakers who advance the Mozilla mission by talking at technical conferences. I generally like talking about Open Source Design (Or Ura Design , ), How Designers and Developers can work better together, FLOSS Philosophy, Community Management and similar topics. I usually talk about examples and experiences within Mozilla, Fedora, SitePoint and Open Labs, but there are exceptions of course.

So if you read my About Me page and like me to speak at your event, send me an email Please include:

* The dates and location of your conference
* The nature of your conference (who do you target, how many people you expect, how many talks will be there)
* The nature of the talk (talk, workshop, panel…)
* If there are any travel arrangements or not and what logistics I need to take care of myself

***Note:*** *I also give workshops and am happy to participate in panels, fireside chats or lightning talks, if you are looking for that as well.*

## Logistics
---

As a Mozilla Tech Speaker, I usually get my costs covered by Mozilla when speaking at a conference important to Mozilla’s mission (and if it’s not on the other side of the globe). So if you intend me to speak about a Mozilla topic at your event, I can arrange to cover my costs. I appreciate a good hotel suggestion so I can book a room there as well. If you have funds to cover some of my costs, I’d be grateful if you could use these funds to sponsor speakers and attendees from under represented groups  and help with diversity stipends instead. I get to travel to a lot of events, it would only be fair to give this chance to other people as well. If your event is outside Europe, getting there might be a bit harder, so feel free to reach out and discuss details.

You aren’t required to give me a lift from the airport to the hotel, although I’d really appreciate that (especially in cities I have never been before).

## Sponsorship Support
---

Although not directly related with speaking, this is aimed at conference organizers, so it might be helpful. In some cases I can help you ask Mozilla for a sponsorship package, when your event aligns with our mission. Time is a big factor here, so let me know ideally 2 or 3 months ahead so I can help you file a request. Similar applies also to Fedora, although the process here is a bit different (and our budget a bit more limited).
If you need swag (stickers, t-shirts, pins and similar) let me know and I could help with that too. I’d be happy to help you with some cool Mozilla, Fedora, SitePoint or FSFE stuff.

## What You Can Expect:
---

* A videocall to finalize details about my talk at your event
* An announcement on my social media channels.
* A trip report of mine regarding the event to follow up and give feedback
* Me mingling in with attendees, speakers and your team during the event\
