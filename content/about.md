## Of [open sourcery](/) and [human-centric](/) design

**Hey, I’m Elio, a UX Designer from Tirana, Albania**. I spend most of my time helping bring better design and usability to open source tools. Coming from a hackerspace community background, I struggled to understand how open source development processes and design can go hand in hand. As I explored this question throughout various Open Source projects, I started designing for communities like Mozilla, The Tor Project, Fedora, Thunderbird and others.

Most of my daily work consists of doing UX Design at [OONI](https://ooni.torproject.org/) and [Ura](v). When I’m wearing my volunteer hat I help out at [Open Source Design](http://www.opensourcedesign.net/) and [Mozilla Tech Speakers](http://www.mozilla.org/). In the past I wrote for [SitePoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/), was part of the [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://www.openlabs.cc/) and co-organized the first five editions of [OSCAL (aka Open Source Conference Albania)](http://oscal.openlabs.cc/)

Have a project for me to collaborate on or you just want to say hi? [Shoot me an email](mailto:ping@elioqoshi.me)!

## Speaking

Oftentimes I have the privilege to talk at conferences and events. If you’d like to hear me blabber about Open Source Design, Security, Privacy and how we can make a sense of all of these together, send me an email with the details. 

I am part of Mozilla Tech Speakers so I had the privilege to go through a good amount of speaker training. If you’d like me to speak at your event but can’t afford to cover my travel, reach out anyway, maybe we can find an alternative way.

I also keep a Trip Log listing all of the events I attended in the past or will attend in the future.
