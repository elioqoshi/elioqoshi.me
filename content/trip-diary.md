In the following I try to list all my travels related to Open Labs, Mozilla, OONI and other general tech events. Not counting events at [Open Labs Hackerspace](https://openlabs.cc/) in Tirana, including [OSCAL](http://www.oscal.openlabs.cc/). You can check out whether I have given a talk in these events and my related trip reports to that.
